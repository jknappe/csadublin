When the end of the season nears and you're still left with some unripe green tomatos on the vines, try out this lovely green tomato chutney that Ciara made for us this year.

This recipe was shamelessly stolen from [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfoodme.com/recipes/janes-green-tomato-chutney/) but lovingly adjusted to suit [Stuie's](/stuie) delicious tomatoes.

## Ingredients

Tomatoes can be substituted with beetroot etc. once you have the vinegar and sugar in.

- 2 kg green tomatoes, roughly chopped
- 500 g cooking apples, peeled and diced
- 1 kg of onions, chopped
- 200 g sultanas

- 1 heaped tsp yellow mustard seeds
- 2 bay leaves
- 6 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 tbsp of mixed spice

- 4 tbsp of olive oil 
- 850 ml cider vinegar
- 500 g light soft brown sugar
- 1 tsp of salt

## Method

1. Heat the oil in a preserving pan, then add the onions and let them gently soften for 10 mins. Add the garlic, spices and bay, and cook for 5 mins more until fragrant. 
2. Tip in the tomatoes, apples and half the vinegar, then simmer for about 15 mins or until the tomatoes and apples are soft. Add the rest of the vinegar, then the sugar, dried fruit and salt, and cook gently until the sugar dissolves. 
3. Turn up the heat a little, then bubble the chutney for about 1 hr 30 mins, or until it is thick and jammy. When ready, you will be able to drag a line across the bottom of the pan without the chutney flooding back straight away. The timing can vary depending on the water content of the tomatoes. Remove the bay leaves before potting the hot chutney into hot, sterilised jars.
