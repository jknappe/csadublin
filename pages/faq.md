### Are you looking for members and how do I join?
Yes, we are looking for new member. Please go to the “Join” section on the website and fill in the membership form. We’ll be in touch with you after that.

### What do I do if I’m on holidays/away?
Just let us know in advance if you will be away, you can also send someone else to pick up your bag.

### What if I can’t attend farm working days, can I send someone else instead?
It is not essential to attend farm work days but members are encouraged to go. Don't worry if you can't attend a particular visit. There will be one each month. It is not necessary to send someone in your place if you can't attend, although people interested in the project but not members can also use farm days to visit.

### What if I move away during the season or want to quit?
Members are encouraged to stay in the system for the season in order to give the grower the security that is needed to commit to the CSA. If you need to opt out, please give one month’s notice to the steering group (csadublin@gmail.com). We will assign your share to somebody on the waiting list; if there is nobody on the waiting list, we would encourage you to sell your share so we can keep our numbers constant.

### Can I downgrade to a half share during the season if it’s too much veg for me?
Yes, it is possible to change your share size during the season. You should try to find someone to replace the vacant half share. Just let the farmer know this is what you plan to do.

### Do you give refunds?
Yes, if there is a good reason for a member leaving. Again, members are encouraged to find a replacement for themselves if they do have to leave during the season.

### What happens with veg that doesn’t get picked up?
It is distributed among other members on the delivery night. Members should normally inform the farmer or membership coordinator if they cannot attend a particular pick up.

### How much does the farmer earn?
The farmer's projected gross income for 2017 is €15000

### Is the veg grown organically?
The veg is all grown organically but is not organically certified.

### Are there other CSAs locally/can you recommend a CSA I can join
